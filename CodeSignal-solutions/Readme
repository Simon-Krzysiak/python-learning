This directory contains solutions to various coding tasks from the website codesignal.com. Each file consists of statement of the problem and my solution. Due to the requierements of the solution-checking system, the name of the 'main' function in each problems, as well as the types of its input and output are fixed. Similarly, in some of the object-oriented tasks it would be more natural to write some of the functions I have written as methods for the appropriate classess, however that was not possible due to the implementation of the checking system. I decided to post my solutions in that form for consistency.
